       <p> Cannabis has crept out of the shadows of the stoner culture and emerged as a multi-billion dollar industry that has taken root in sectors including healthcare, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, and agriculture.
</p>
<p>Public companies with ballooning valuations are racing to be the most innovative, while established blue-chip companies are partnering or buying marijuana-related businesses to gain access to the industry.</p>

<p>As the legal cannabis industry continues to develop and public support for the legalization of recreational and medical marijuana use grows, an increasing number of investors have taken note. The latest Gallup poll released in November 2020 indicates that 68% of American adults support the legalization of marijuana in the U.S, up sharply from only 12% who supported it more than five decades ago in 1969, Today it has been made legal in all states in the united states.
</p>
<p>Cannabis stocks, represented by the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ), have soared over the past year as several more states legalized the recreational and medical uses.
</p>
<p>With interest in pot stocks rising, many new and veteran investors without intimate knowledge of the business are considering making investments in cannabis companies and stocks. As with any new industry, learning about the ins and outs of the diverse and fast-growing marijuana business can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>Marijuana is legal in seven countries while others have mixed/localized laws that allow its use for either recreational or medical purposes—or both. Uruguay was the first country to legalize it for recreational purposes. Jamaica decriminalized cannabis in 2015 and the country saw its first medical dispensary open up three years later.</p>

<p>In October 2018, marijuana became legal for recreational and medical use in Canada.</p>

<p>As of July 2021, 18 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia legalized recreational marijuana. A total of 36 states and three territories legalized medical marijuana.
</p>
<p>The global marijuana market was estimated to be worth $21.3 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to $55.9 billion by 2026.
</p>
<p>This growth is expected to be fueled by an increase in demand (thanks to the increasing degree of legalization around the world) along with a rise in the use of medical marijuana.</p>

<p>Legal marijuana companies are able to leverage one important advantage, which makes them slightly different from those in the tech sector. While tech companies often need to create demand or to educate their consumer base, marijuana startups face no lack of demand—especially in North America.Investors who once backed tech firms are now funneling capital into the cannabis industry. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel's Founders Fund became the first institutional investor to put money into the legal marijuana industry. The fund was the lead investor in Privateer Holding's Series B funding worth $75 million in April 2015. Privateer Holdings has multiple cannabis investments.</p>

<p>Calvin Broadus, a.k.a. Snoop Dogg, is another notable investor in the industry. The rapper makes no secret of his affinity for marijuana and is the director of Casa Verde Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in cannabis startups.
</p>
<p>The company's portfolio includes names like Dutchie, Green Tank, and Cannalysis.</p>

<p>And he's not the only celebrity seeing green. Singer Justin Bieber partnered with California-based Palms to release packs of pre-rolled joints called Peaches in October 2021.Martha Stewart launched her own brand of CBD products, including wellness gummies and oil drops, after partnering with Canopy Growth. Stewart released the line in September 2020. DIddy just got started.</p>
